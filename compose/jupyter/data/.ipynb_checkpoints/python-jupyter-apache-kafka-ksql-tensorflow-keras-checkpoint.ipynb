    "This notebook uses the combination of Python, Apache Kafka, KSQL for Machine Learning infrastructures. \n",
    "\n",
    "It includes code examples using ksql-python and other widespread components from Pythonâ€™s machine learning ecosystem, like Numpy, pandas, TensorFlow and Keras. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use case is fraud detection for credit card payments. We use a test data set from Kaggle as foundation to train an unsupervised autoencoder to detect anomalies and potential fraud in payments. Focus of this example is not just model training, but the whole Machine Learning infrastructure including data ingestion, data preprocessing, model training, model deployment and monitoring. All of this needs to be scalable, reliable and performant.\n",
